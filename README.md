### Related to my studies

My studies included implementing various numerical methods and learning good code pracices in languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. Here I also got familiar with ASP.NET API creation and integration of Microsoft Azure. I learned to make desktop apps using Microsoft WPF, UWP and MAUI, as well as web fronts with Vue and React. I also got familiar with design templates and databases. (Both relational and non-relational.)

The example projects related to my studies are [C++ Expression templates](https://github.com/piotrf230/cpp-expr-templates), [Langton's Ant](https://github.com/piotrf230/langtons-ant) and [Lanczos Algorithm implementation](https://github.com/piotrf230/lanczos-algorithm)

### Related to my thesis

My engineering thesis includes laying fundations for a Blazor web app, which allows users to manage and mass deploy docker containers on the server. The fundamental features include creation of images with dockerfile support, creation, mass creation, running, stopping and deletion of containers, and provides basic container stats, gives access to container logs and allows the user to execute commands in the container. On top of that, the app is styled with Tailwind and Flowbite to ensure good visuals that are not to flashy for people more accustomed to terminal.

### Related to hobbies

I always was passionate about videogames with a dream of making some of my own. this is the reason I learned both Unity and Godot game engines. I'm familiar with Unity up to 6.0 (latest LTS for the moment of writing) and it's newest features such as UI Toolkit and Input System. I'm also familiar with Godot and can create games both in GDScript, as well as C#, and know the basic principles of shaders.

My games are available on [my Itch.io page](https://piotrf230.itch.io/).
